  - Culture Fit Questions
      - During this interview, companies see if a candidate would be a good fit for their culture. Candidate should not show any red flag. Some sample questions:
      - How good programmer/developer/student were you in the past? Your resume, work history, side/open source projects, educational project, all play a major role here.
      - What kind of co-worker would you be? The interviewer will try to evaluate if they would like to work with you in a team. Your motivation, empathy, and perseverance will be assessed.
      - Do you strive for success and growth? Remember that you are applying at one of the top companies in the world, they would like to hire above-average people.
      - Some of the basic rules of Cultural fit interviews are:

          1. Show interest in the product, and demonstrate an understanding of it. (I once had a candidate who told me that Facebook sells cloud services like AWS (Storage/Compute). He had even used one of those. Now, Facebook did buy Parse.com and kept it alive for a while, but Cloud Infrastructure was never Facebook’s primary/core business).

          2. Be ready to describe scenarios where you had a conflict with your teammates or managers and how you resolved it. Please don’t say that you never had a conflict if you’ve been working as a software engineer for a few years.

          3. Talk about what you want to accomplish in the company

          4. Talk about some of your recent / most significant accomplishments as an engineer

          5. Talk about some particularly crazy/difficult bugs that you encountered.
