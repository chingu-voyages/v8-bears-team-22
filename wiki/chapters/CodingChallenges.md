- <details><summary><b>Introduction to Coding Challenges</b></summary>

   - Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

    **Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

    Why you need to practice doing programming problems:

    - problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
    - gathering requirements for the problem
    - talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
    - coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
    - coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
    - testing your solutions

    There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming interview books, too, but I found this outstanding: [Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

    No whiteboard at home? That makes sense. I'm a weirdo and have a big whiteboard. Instead of a whiteboard, pick up a large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice.
