# Interview Prep App

<details> <summary><b>APP NAME IDEAS</b></summary>

- **Interview Prep App** (pretty straightforward)
- **Interview Prepper**
- **Interview Junkie** (successfully passing an interview is a skill one can develop like a muscle, so like gym junkie, but interview junkie)
- **Interview Freak** (again, like obsessed with interview preparation)
- **Interview100** (like #100DaysOfCode but for interviews. This could be a separate idea on its own. Maybe we could incorporate this concept and build the curriculum around it. e.g. plan 100 days before the interview and what can you fit into that time)
- **sowe web2.0 style names** (preppy, preppify, applikant)
- **Zhungbei-le!/Zhungbei-hao-le** (Chinese for *Prepared*!)
